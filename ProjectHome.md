<h3>Genifer is a general inference engine based on logic and inductive learning, with an emphasis on self-programming.</h3>
<p>Its aim is to be universally applicable both as an embedded software component <i>and</i> as a high-level operating system and environment.</p>

<b>The current Prototype (v1) consists of:</b>

1) a simple NL (English) interface

2) deduction, including deductive planning

> a) backward chaining

> b) forward chaining

3) inductive learning

The "ouroboros" logo came from Abram's analogy that RSI (recursive self-improvement) is like a snake eating its own tail.

Cobra is a .NET/Mono language with Python-like syntax.  We will develop on both Java and .NET platforms.  Currently a prototype in Lisp is available, and will be ported to Java + Scala + Clojure.  The prototypes on different platforms can have variations, so we can explore more algorithmic ideas.<br>
